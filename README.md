Automated Password Generator

Years ago, I started using Adel I. Mirzazhanov's apg (Automated Password Generator). It was easy to use, had all the features I needed/wanted (like Pronounceable Password Generation), and was included in most package managers. Sadly, in 2017, the project went offline, and stopped responding to email, and was removed from most package managers, including [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/10126).

This project is a fork of the original apg, recovered from the homepage [http://www.adel.nursat.kz/apg](https://web.archive.org/web/20130313042424/http://www.adel.nursat.kz:80/apg) using the Internet Archive [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org). Releases were imported from the original tarballs back-dated to the reported release dates with help from [leewc](https://leewc.com/articles/making-past-git-commits/) and [alexpeattie](https://alexpeattie.com/blog/working-with-dates-in-git).
