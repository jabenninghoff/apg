                     pronunciation guide for unix
                               29 Apr 97




       How do I pronounce "vi" , or "!", or "/*", or ...?
    You can start a very long and pointless discussion by wondering
    about this topic on the net.  Some people say "vye", some say
    "vee-eye" (the vi manual suggests this) and some Roman numerologists
    say "six".  How you pronounce "vi" has nothing to do with whether
    or not you are a true Unix wizard.

    Similarly, you'll find that some people pronounce "char" as "care",
    and that there are lots of ways to say "#" or "/*" or "!" or
    "tty" or "/etc".  No one pronunciation is correct - enjoy the regional
    dialects and accents.

    Since this topic keeps coming up on the net, here is a comprehensive
    pronunciation list that has made the rounds.

				-- NOTES --

! bang		comes from old card punch phenom where punching ! code made a
		loud noise; however, this pronunciation is used in the (non-
		computerized) publishing and typesetting industry in the U.S.
		too, so ...
		Alternatively it could have come from comic books, where the
		words each character utters are shown in a "balloon" near that
		character's head.  When one character shoots another, it is
		common to see a balloon pointing at the barrel of the gun to
		denote that the gun had been fired, not merely aimed. 
		That balloon contained the word "!" -- hence, "!" == "Bang!" 
! store		from FORTH
! dammit	as in "quit, dammit!" while exiting vi and hoping one hasn't
		clobbered a file too badly
# octothorpe	from Bell System (orig. octalthorpe)
# unequal	e.g. Modula-2
$ string	from BASIC
$ escape	from TOPS-10
$ Sonne		In the "socialist" countries they used and are using all kinds
		of IBM clones (hardware + sw). It was a common practice just
		to rename everything (IBM 360 --> ESER 1040 etc.).
		Of course the "dollar" sign had to be renamed - it became the
		"international currency symbol" which looks like a circle with
		4 rays spreading from it:
			  ____
			\/    \/
			/      \
			\      /
			/\____/\

		Because it looks like a (small) shining sun, in the German
		Democratic Republic it was usually called "Sonne" (sun).
& donald duck	from the Danish "Anders And", which means "Donald Duck"
* splat		from DEC "spider" glyph
* Nathan Hale	"I have but one asterisk for my country."
* funny button	at Pacific Bell, * was referred to by employees as the "funny
		button", which did not please management at all when it became
		part of the corporate logo of Pacific Telesis, the holding
		company ...
