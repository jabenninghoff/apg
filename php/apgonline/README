NOTES
 a) APG Online uses cookie to save Your settings, so You should enable
 cookie support in Your browser settings.
 
 b) I'm not a designer, so themes included in APG distribution is just to
 demonstrate a new feature. You can suggest your own theme to include in the
 APG distribution.
 
 c) Password quality checks are not supported in PHP frontend because,
 if implemented, it can slow down your web server. But you can add
 support for them at your own risk.
